#SuperCell x Hive 2025 Game Chanllenge

#Overview
a simple survivor like game and the task is that we will built up top of it, however, we want. 

#Intrustions
- After cmake, the executable name survive should be in /build/bin
- The user has to select a weapon to start the game
- The controls are the default controls. Use the arrow keys to move and space bar to attack.
- A point system is also added to the top.

#What I added
- I added a bow type of weapon that shoots out a yellow arrow and upon colliding with the vampire, it will kill the vampire and remove the vampire.
- A different type of starting screen. It no longers start after a certain time but based on user input.
- a simple point system that keep tracks of how many you killed

#What I wish I could add more
- I really wanted to add an affix to the game (inspired by WoW). I wanted to include a bloodpool that spawns after each vampire is killed.
- the blood pool will spawn after one second of vampire's death and it will stay there for 3 seconds
- each vampire that walks into the pool will have its speed increased for 1 or 2 seconds
- a list of items that drops after every 5 kills of vampire
- the player can pick up three at max and press F to use it.
- the item in use will always be the item that you pick up the earliest (compare time picked up)
